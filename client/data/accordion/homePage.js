    header: "A Dynamic solution for all Sailboats",
    text: "The CDI Flexible Furler is suitable for use on daysailers, offshore passage makers, monohulls, and multihulls. It is used by production boat builders and is great as a retrofit. The flexible luff extrusion makes it the best choice for trailerables. This makes it a versatile furling system that can be used on different types of boats.",

    header: "Advantages of a furling system",
    text: "Whether large or small, your cruising boat or daysailer should have a furling system. Going forward on any size boat is potentially wet and often dangerous, particularly if your crew is inexperienced. Changing sails as the wind comes up is not a lot of fun! The Flexible Furler can be used to both furl and reef your sail in any wind condition. This makes it a safer and more convenient option for sailors.",

    header: "reliability and cost",
    text: "CDI has eliminated expensive features only hard-core racers demand, thereby increasing the system’s reliability while lowering the cost. This means that the Flexible Furler is a cost-effective option for sailors who do not want to spend a lot of time and money buying or maintaining their equipment. The system’s reliability is backed up by the fact that 100% of Flexible Furler owners surveyed by Practical Sailor would buy their Flexible Furler again if they had the choice.",
